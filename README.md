From the total signups, 64.8% attended synchronously and 79.6% completed
the post workshop survey, in which we obtained an average Net Promoter
Score (NPS) of 88.9% (min = 71.4, max = 100). This is considered
excellent, as the NPS ranges from -100% to +100%, and values larger than
+50%—our target—reflect very high satisfaction from the participants.

### Metrics by workshop

| Workshops | \# editions | \# hours | \# signups | \# attendees | Signups per edition | Attendees per edition | NPS (%) | Post surveys completed (%) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ALTa Ciencia Abierta (Open Science 101) | 4 | 63 | 494 | 287 | 123.5 | 71.8 | 79.7 | 67.6 |
| How to Teach Programming Online | 9 | 27 | 215 | 101 | 23.9 | 11.2 | 92.7 | 87.3 |
| Present! Resources for Active Meetings | 65 | 195 | 1434 | 935 | 22.1 | 14.4 | 87.2 | 88.8 |

| Others | 11 | 23 | 169 | 151 | 15.4 | 13.7 | 95.2 | 82.3 |

Among the most popular workshops is Present! Resources for Active
Meetings, which held 65 editions and drew over 1,400 participants,
serving as a major gateway to the MetaDocencia community, and ALTa
Ciencia Abierta—the Latin American contextualization of NASA’s Open
Science 101—which held the larger number of sign-ups and attendees per
edition, over 100 and 70 respectively. Meanwhile, workshops like How to
Teach Programming Online and Train the Trainer stand out for their high
satisfaction and retention levels, marking the beginning of a learning
community capable of sustaining and multiplying its impact over time.

### Metrics by year

Since its inception, MetaDocencia has shown consistent and strategic
growth in its educational offerings, reflecting the development of a
committed and collaborative learning community across Latin America.

| Year | \# editions | \# hours | \# signups | \# attendees | Signups per edition | Attendees per edition | NPS (%) | Post surveys completed (%) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2020 | 44 | 143 | 985 | 673 | 22.4 | 15.3 | NaN | 100.0 |
| 2021 | 34 | 109 | 602 | 455 | 17.7 | 13.4 | 92.1 | 85.3 |
| 2022 | 6 | 42 | 148 | 80 | 24.7 | 13.3 | 100.0 | 100.0 |
| 2023 | 6 | 24 | 257 | 137 | 42.8 | 22.8 | 79.2 | 86.7 |
| 2024 | 4 | 70 | 412 | 213 | 103.0 | 53.2 | 83.0 | 61.0 |

In the early years (2020–2021), the focus was on short, high-demand
workshops, with a total of 78 editions in just two years. These
introductory sessions—often one-day events—emerged as a rapid response
to the urgent educational needs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, and
allowed MetaDocencia to reach over 1500 participants, positioning the
initiative as a key player in digital teacher training.

Starting in 2022, a clear shift in strategy becomes evident. While the
overall number of editions decreased, the depth and structure of the
training offerings increased. MetaDocencia began to implement
cohort-based programs and more extensive workshops, such as the Train
the Trainer initiative and ALTa Ciencia Abierta. This transition led to
a higher average workshop duration (from 3 to more than 15 hours per
edition) and a growing number of participants per edition, with recent
years averaging over 100 sign-ups and 50 attendees per course.

In summary, the data show a clear shift from breadth to depth: from
numerous one-off introductory sessions to fewer, more intensive programs
with higher engagement and learning outcomes per edition. This evolution
reflects MetaDocencia’s maturing role as a community of practice,
capable of delivering meaningful, sustainable, and regionally grounded
educational experiences.
